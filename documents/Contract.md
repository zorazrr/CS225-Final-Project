# Team Contract

## Communication

1. **Team Meetings** Our team will meet every Monday from 4-6 PM using Zoom. During the meeting, each team member will contribute to a notes document on Google Docs, time-stamped for each meeting. The team will also work together to draft the weekly DEVELOPMENT LOG entry.

2. **Assistance** The team's main method of communication will be Messenger, but each team member can also be contacted through email or text. Outside of emergencies or other urgent commitments, the team will uphold a policy of responding to messages within 12 hours.

3. **Respect** During our meetings, each team member will act in a respectful manner, ensuring that every other team member has had a chance to speak and voice their opinions. Furthermore, while unanimous agreement is preferred, all decisions will be made through majority opinion. By signing this document, each team member agrees to adhering to the guidelines written on this contract.

## Collaboration

1. **Work Distribution** The main goal and deliverables for each week will be decided by the entire team. Each member will volunteer to work on at least one deliverable. If no one volunteers, someone will be randomly assigned to work on that task; if the task is rather large, another team member will also be randomly assigned to the task to work on it as a pair. Adjustments will be made as needed.

2. **Time Commitment** To ensure an equal distribution of work, each team member should only complete two to four hours of independent work per week for the project. If a certain team member's workload is especially large, other team members should assist with the unforeseen complication. It is the team's responsibility, not any individual's, to make sure everything is finished by the end of the week. In the scenario that a team member has another circumstance that may cause them to continuously leave their tasks unfinished, the team will take the proper further actions (ex: contacting a staff member). 

3. **Conflict Resolution** All conflicts within the team will be solved through majority rule. If there is a split amongst all three team members, the decision will be randomly made through a game of chance such as a random number generator.
