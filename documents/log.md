# Development Log

## Week 1

This week, our goals were to implement the Node class, construct the adjacency list for the Node Latitude Longitude (NLL) dataset, and set up a small test dataset. We accomplished all of these tasks this week.

Ellie: This week, something unfortunate happened in my personal life and I wasn’t feeling emotionally or physically well enough to complete my class work, which I notified my group members of. However, I will try my best to be fully back on track next week.

Grace: I worked with Zora to figure out the structure of the Node class and extracted a small subset of data for us to use with testing. I also implemented our Graph class’s constructor and the helper functions necessary for us to use our data to create a graph.

Zora: I set up the repo structure, including file storage, classes, and basic test and make files, with Grace. We determined the private members within each class and created general necessary functions like getters and setters. 

Thankfully, everything went relatively smoothly, and we were able to meet all of our goals. The biggest challenge was deciding on how exactly we would create our graph, but after discussing the issue amongst ourselves, we were able to successfully implement the constructor and helper function. 

Next week, our exciting plan is to implement the finding shortest path functionality through the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm and set up test cases for it. We also want to set up test cases for our graph’s constructor, to see if it creates the desired adjacency list from our input files successfully.

## Week 2
This week, our goals were to complete the Node class (set up the .cpp file and include any further necessary helper functions), create the MakeFile, begin setting up tests for our functions, and implement the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm. We wanted to make sure our Graph class was working as expected before starting the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm, and to do that we needed to have our MakeFile working. However, because we ran into issues with our MakeFile, we weren’t able to run our test cases. 

Ellie: This week, I coded the entirety of the Node.cpp file and implemented two helper functions to calculate the distance between two latitude/longitude coordinate pairs.

Grace: I implemented road.cpp, created smaller test files, and wrote extensive test cases to test the functionality of our Graph class.

Zora: This week I worked on getting the Makefile working. I also fixed some small mistakes throughout the files now that we are able to compile and the compiler starts to complain about things.

Next week (now that our MakeFile has been set up), we’ll implement the Floyd-Warshall algorithm as well as the K-D tree.
