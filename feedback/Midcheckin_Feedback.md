### Comments
The team was able to accurately summarize progress being made and has a reasonable plan for what they hope to accomplish before the final project deadline. More than one project goal was completed. The code for Djikstra's Algorithm and Welsh Powell were available. There were test cases for the graph class and Djikstra's Algorithm. The code built correctly and all the tests ran and passed. Overall, great progress so far.
